            <p>I’m a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, passionate about HCI, AI, and ML. I’ve interned at Finabot Canada Inc., contributing to the Shipora website for an international shipping company, utilizing my knowledge of HCI to develop the site to be user-intuitive. I am dedicated to giving back to the community. Having founded my local Amnesty International chapter, I have led initiatives that give back to local community and promote social activism's intersection with technology. I enjoy bringing tech into all aspects of my life! Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or have a question!</p>

            <p>Skycraft is a prototype designed to assist first responders by providing 3D renders of disaster-affected areas using drone-captured video footage. The project integrates drone video capture, Raspberry Pi for temperature sensor data, and Google Cloud for video storage. On the backend, COLMAP and a 3D Gaussian Splatting model are used for 3D reconstruction. The frontend is built with React and Vite to display 3D models and temperature data in real time.</p>

        <p>
            As the President and Founder of CPSS Amnesty International, I led a team of over 10 indiividuals, conducting weekly check-in meetings, delegating tasks, and coordinating social activities to ensure team cohesion. I managed communication within the team, keeping everyone informed about upcoming events and projects, demonstrating my leadership and organizational skills. I conducted extensive research on human rights violations and key global events to create content for social media platforms, raising awareness and encouraging individuals to take action. Additionally, I highlighted the intersection of technology and activism, advocating for the importance of STEM in driving social change. My efforts contributed to raising hundreds of dollars and gathering thousands of signatures for petitions aimed at supporting human rights protection. Furthermore, I leveraged my technical skills to develop tools and platforms that streamlined the organization’s operations, improving communication, event organization, and outreach, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the team’s initiatives.
