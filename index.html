            <h1>Haley Patel</h1>
            <p>I’m a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, passionate about HCI, Web Dev, Full-Stack, and AR/VR. I’ve interned at Finabot Canada Inc., contributing to the Shipora website for an international shipping company, utilizing my knowledge of HCI to develop the site to be user-intuitive. I am dedicated to giving back to the community. Having founded my local Amnesty International chapter, I have led initiatives that give back to local community and promote social activism's intersection with technology. I enjoy bringing tech into all aspects of my life! Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or have any questions!</p>
